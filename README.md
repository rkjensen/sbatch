# Sbatch library
This is a simple library to run sbatch commands normally coupled to other scripts where automated submission to the slurm queue is wanted.
It is set up for the EMBL, heidelberg HPC but should be easily configured for others who are interested.

It is provided as is, and is updated to fix specific problems in my work, not to be a universel tool.
